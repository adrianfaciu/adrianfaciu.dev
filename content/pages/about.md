I am mostly interested in **front-end development** and **technical leadership**.

I'm excited about many technologies and I'm always trying to get better at what I do. Not afraid to open a terminal and always trying to understand how things work. Trying to be as unopinionated as possible and get the best out of any technology or framework.

I've started with .NET/C# around 2008/2009 and moved towards front-end some years ago. I'm still involved in the technical side of things as much as possible, but lately I've focused more on understanding what a Staff+ engineer does and what should we do as technical leaders for a greater impact.

For the first two editions, in 2019 and 2023 I was involved in organizing [revo.js conference](https://revojs.ro/). This is a not-for-profit event taking place in Timișoara, Romania.

#### Sometimes I present at smaller events. I was invited to a few podcasts or even host workshops:

- Beyond senior @ All-stack hangout
- What it means to be a senior developer @ tim.js meetup
- SPA, SSR, SSG: How Remix gets the best of all worlds @ tim.js meetup
- Sharing code at runtime: module federation @ tim.js meetup
- TypeScript @ internal WeVideo presentation
- Web components with LitElement @ tim.js meetup
- Web components for everyone @ Codecamp Timisoara

- Barrel files: to use or not to use @ tim.js meetup
- Angular state management (2 days) @ internal Visma workshop

I have many hobbies like hiking, running, playing board/video games, taking photos and so on. It's like each month I find a new one :)
