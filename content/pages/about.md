Software developer interested in **front-end web development**.

I'm excited about many technologies and I'm always trying to get better at what I do. Not afraid to open a terminal and always trying to understand how things work. Trying to be as unopinionated as possible and get the best out of any technology and framework.

I've started with .NET/C# around 2008/2009 and moved towards front-end some years ago. If you want to look at **my CV**, you can find it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/adrianfaciu).

Sometimes I present at smaller events/podcasts and some of them are recorded:

- [NgRx Tips & Tricks](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-214-ngrx-tips-tricks-with-adrian-faciu/) @ Adventures in Angular podcast
- [NgRx Tips & Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giR8nUtM_mw&feature=youtu.be) @ Voxxed Days Frontend Bucharest
- [Taking Angular offline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3GHo2GFyVs&t=2s) @ tim.js meetup
- [Adrian FÃ¢ciu](https://devchat.tv/my-angular-story/mas-074-adrian-faciu/) @ My Angular Story

I have many hobbies like hiking, playing board games and taking photos. You can see some of them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adrian.faciu/).
